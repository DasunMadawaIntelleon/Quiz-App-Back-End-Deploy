  - This file, providing an overview of the repository's structure and contents.

## Git Feature Branch Workflow

In this repository, we follow the **Feature Branch Workflow** to ensure that new features, bug fixes, and improvements are developed in isolation before they are integrated into the main codebase. Below is an overview of how the workflow operates:

### Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the Git Feature Branch Workflow:

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial Commit"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Set up project"
    
    branch feature/feature-1
    checkout feature/feature-1
    commit id: "Work on feature 1"
    commit id: "Finish feature 1"
    
    checkout develop
    merge feature/feature-1 id: "Merge feature-1 branch"
    commit id: "Prepare for release"
    
    branch feature/feature-2
    branch feature/feature-2-developer-x
    checkout feature/feature-2
    commit id: "Work on feature-2"

    checkout feature/feature-2-developer-x
    commit id: "Developer-x work on feature-2"

    checkout feature/feature-2
    merge feature/feature-2-developer-x id: "Merge developer-x branch"

    checkout develop
    merge feature/feature-2 id: "Merge feature-2 branch"
    commit id: "Release version 1.0"

```

## How to Use

1. Navigate through the `docs/` folder for important project documentation such as API specs, ER diagrams, and architecture decisions.
2. Explore the `code/` folder to view and work on the projectâ€™s frontend and backend code.
3. Refer to the `.gitignore` file to understand what files are ignored from version control.
